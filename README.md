# üöÄ PIC Microcontroller Mini Projects

Welcome to the **PIC Microcontroller Mini Projects** repository! This collection showcases a variety of beginner-friendly microcontroller projects built with PIC, designed to explore different functionalities like 7-segment displays, countdowns, and motor control.

Each project is self-contained in a zipped folder, which includes all necessary files for replication and further exploration.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

Each folder contains:
- **C Code** (`.c`): Source code in C for the project.
- **Hex Code** (`.hex`): Compiled code ready to upload to the PIC microcontroller.
- **Proteus Project** (`.pdsprj`): Schematic and simulation files for Proteus.
- **Detailed Explanation**: A step-by-step guide on how the project works.
