# üöÄ PIC Microcontroller Mini Projects

Welcome to the **PIC Microcontroller Mini Projects** repository! This collection includes several exciting microcontroller-based projects using PIC, each demonstrating a unique application of hardware and software. All projects come with source code, Proteus simulation files, and detailed explanations.

Each project is contained in a zip folder, which includes the following:
- **C Code** (`.c`): The source code for the project.
- **Hex Code** (`.hex`): The compiled code ready to upload to the PIC microcontroller.
- **Proteus Project** (`.pdsprj`): The circuit schematic and simulation for Proteus.
- **Explanation**: A detailed breakdown of how the project works.

## üìú Project List

### 1. **4-Digit Password Verification System with LCD Display**
   - **Description**: This project implements a 4-digit password verification system using a 4x4 keypad and an LCD display. The system allows a user to set a password and verify it by inputting the digits. A success or failure message is displayed based on the entered password.

### 2. **Button-Activated LED Counter**
   - **Description**: A simple button-controlled counter that increments with each press and displays the count via LED blinking. For example, pressing the button once would blink the LED once, pressing twice would blink it twice, and so on.

### 3. **Cascading Count Display on Dual 7-Segment Displays**
   - **Description**: This project displays a number from 00 to 99 on two 7-segment displays, showing one digit at a time in sequence.

### 4. **Interactive Keypad Display - Showing Pressed Numbers on LCD**
   - **Description**: This system uses a keypad to capture the numbers pressed by the user and displays them on an LCD. Each key press is shown on the LCD, allowing for easy interaction with the user.

### 5. **Multi-Directional Motor Control Using Push Buttons**
   - **Description**: Controls two motors in multiple directions using push buttons. One button makes both motors rotate clockwise, another makes them rotate counterclockwise, and a third controls each motor in opposite directions.

### 6. **Single Digit Scrolling Display for Student ID with PIC Microcontroller**
   - **Description**: Displays each digit of a student ID one by one on a 7-segment display. The digits are shown in a sequential manner, one after the other.

### 7. **Traffic Light Controller with Countdown Timer and 7-Segment Display**
   - **Description**: A traffic light system that includes a countdown timer. When a button is pressed, a 7-segment display shows a countdown from 9 to 0. Once the countdown ends, the corresponding traffic light turns green.

## üíª Getting Started

1. **Unzip** the folder of the desired project.
2. **Open** the `.pdsprj` file in **Proteus** to view and simulate the circuit.
3. Use the **C code** to understand the logic or modify it for custom applications.
4. Load the **Hex file** onto your PIC microcontroller if you want to replicate the project in hardware.
